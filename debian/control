Description: Trunk gating system
 Zuul is a program that is used to gate the source code repository of a project
 so that changes are only merged if they pass tests.
 .
 The main component of Zuul is the scheduler. It receives events related to
 proposed changes (currently from Gerrit), triggers tests based on those events
 (currently on Jenkins), and reports back.
