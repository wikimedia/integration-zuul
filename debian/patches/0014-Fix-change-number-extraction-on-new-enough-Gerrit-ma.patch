Subject: Fix change number extraction on new enough Gerrit master

Apparently, there's been a change in recent upstream Gerrit which
changed the JSON serialization of change numbers in the output of
`gerrit stream-events`. Previously, the change number was being
transmitted as a string. That has changed and now it's being sent as a
number. That results in a failure later on:

 2017-02-14 15:35:55,294 ERROR zuul.IndependentPipelineManager: Exception while launching job XXX for change <Change 0x7f3efc185c90 64,1>:

      self.number[-2:], self.number, self.patchset)
  TypeError: 'int' object has no attribute '__getitem__'

I would love to have this extended this with a proper testcase. Please
feel free to push an updated version over this patchset, or just let me
know which place is the most appropriate and I can do it myself, too.
