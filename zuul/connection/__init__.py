    A connection is a shared object that sources, triggers and reporters can
    use to speak with a remote API without needing to establish a new
    connection each time or without having to authenticate each time.

    Multiple instances of the same connection may exist with different
    credentials, for example, thus allowing for different pipelines to operate
    on different Gerrit installations or post back as a different user etc.

    Connections can implement their own public methods. Required connection
    methods are validated by the {trigger, source, reporter} they are loaded
    into. For example, a trigger will likely require some kind of query method
    while a reporter may need a review method."""
