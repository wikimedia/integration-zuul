    The alembic version table is fixed to being prefixed too. This is necessary
    when using :attr:`<sql connection>.table_prefix`. However if you are
    already using ``table_prefix`` you will need to rename the table
    ``alembic_version`` to ``<prefix>alembic_version`` before starting Zuul.
    Otherwise zuul will try to create the tables again and fail. If you're not
    using ``table_prefix`` you can safely ignore this.
