    The :attr:`job.secrets.pass-to-parent` attribute has been added to
    allow secrets to be made available to playbooks in parent jobs
    (for example, to allow for jobs which are designed to use secrets,
    but leave it to child jobs to actually supply them).  See also the
    :ref:`secret` documentation.
