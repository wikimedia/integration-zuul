    Story 2001441 is fixed. Failure by one Zuul reporter will not short
    circuit the reporting of other reporters. This ensures as much
    information as possible is reported for each change even if some
    failures occur. Note that the build set status is changed to 'ERROR'
    after the first failed reporter.
