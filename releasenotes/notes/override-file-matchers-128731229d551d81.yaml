    Files (and irrelevant-files) matchers are now overridable.  Zuul
    now uses only branch matchers to collect job variants.  Once those
    variants are collected, they are combined, and the files and
    irrelevant-files attributes are inherited and overridden as any
    other job attribute.  The final values are used to determine
    whether the job should ultimately run.
  - Zuul now uses Ansible 2.5.

    Tobias Henkel (BMW Car IT GmbH) discovered a vulnerability which
    is fixed in this release. If nodes become offline during the
    build, the no_log attribute of a task is ignored. If the
    unreachable error occurred in a task used with a loop variable
    (e.g., with_items), the contents of the loop items would be
    printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally leaking
    credentials or secrets. MITRE has assigned CVE-2018-12557 to this
    vulnerability.
