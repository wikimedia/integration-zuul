    Zuul role repository checkouts now honor :attr:`job.override-checkout`.

    Previously, when a Zuul role was specified for a job, Zuul would
    usually checkout the master branch, unless that repository
    appeared in the dependency chain for a patch.  It will now follow
    the usual procedure for determining the branch to check out,
    including honoring :attr:`job.override-checkout` options.

    This may alter the behavior of currently existing jobs.  Depending
    on circumstances, you may need to set
    :attr:`job.override-checkout` or copy roles to other branches of
    projects.
