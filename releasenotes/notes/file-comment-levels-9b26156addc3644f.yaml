    The annotation levels for the file comments reported via Github checks
    API are now configurable in ``zuul_return``. Each file comment entry can
    provide an optional ``level`` parameter ``[info|warning|error]`` that will
    be picked up by the Github reporter.

    For more details on how to provide file comments from Zuul, see the
    documentation of the :ref:`return_values`.
