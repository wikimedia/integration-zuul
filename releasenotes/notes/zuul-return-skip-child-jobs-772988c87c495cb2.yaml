    It is now possible to use zuul_return to skip child jobs. You can
    use the :var:`zuul.child_jobs` inventory variable to get a list of
    child jobs configured to run, then use zuul_return to modify the
    list.  Any child job not in zuul_return zuul.child_jobs will be
    skipped. See :ref:`return_values` for examples.
