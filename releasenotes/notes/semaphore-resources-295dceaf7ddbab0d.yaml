    A job using a semaphore now can configure if it should acquire the it
    before requesting resources or just before running.
upgrade:
  - |
    The acquiring behavior of jobs with semaphores has been changed. Up to now
    a job requested resources and aquired the semaphore just before it started
    to run. However this could lead to a high amount of resource waste. Instead
    jobs now acquire the semaphore before requesting the resources by default.
    This behavior can be overridden by jobs using
    :attr:`job.semaphore.resources-first` if some waste of resources is
    acceptable.
