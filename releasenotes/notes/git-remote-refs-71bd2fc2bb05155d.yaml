    Git repositories will have a ``origin`` remote with refs pointing to the
    previous change in the speculative state.

    This allows jobs to determine the commits that are part of a change, which
    was not possible before. The remote URL is set to a bogus value which
    won't work with git commands that need to talk to the remote repository.
