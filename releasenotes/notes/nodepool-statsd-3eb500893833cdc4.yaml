    The `zuul.nodepool` statistics have been moved under
    `zuul.nodepool.requests` to allow sub-stats to work correctly.
    For example `zuul.nodepool.requested` has become
    `zuul.nodepool.requests.requested.total`.  The previously missing
    `label` and `size` counters are now available at
    `zuul.nodepool.requests.<state>.<size|label>`.  For more info see
    the monitoring documentation.
  # NOTE(pabelanger): We are adding this here, so reno properly updates in the
  # 3.4.0 section.

    The zuul-web service now requires access to ZooKeeper, as a result you may
    need to update your firewall allow access from the service. Additionally,
    zuul.conf should now contain a :attr:`zookeeper` configuration section.
