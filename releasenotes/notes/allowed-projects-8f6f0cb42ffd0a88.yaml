    Jobs with secrets in untrusted projects now automatically set
    `allowed-projects`.

    It is possible to circumvent the use of `allowed-projects` in
    untrusted projects by creating a change which `Depends-On` a
    change which alters a project definition.  This behavior may be
    unexpected, so documentation has been updated with warnings to
    avoid relying on it in sensitive cases.

    It may have been possible to expose a secret, or use resources
    protected by a secret, if a job using a secret was defined in an
    untrusted project on a system with an independent pre-merge
    post-review pipeline -- that is, a pipeline with `post-review` set
    to true, `manager` set to `independent`, and which operated on
    changes before they merged.

    To prevent disclosure or use in this situation, `allowed-projects`
    is now automatically set to the current project when a secret is
    used in a job defined in an untrusted project, and it can not be
    overridden.
