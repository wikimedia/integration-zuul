    The default for :attr:`<gerrit connection>.auth_type` has changed from
    ``digest`` to ``basic``.  Digest authentication has not been supported
    in Gerrit since version 2.15.

    If your Zuul connects to an older version of Gerrit via HTTP
    authentication, you may now need to explicitly set this value.
