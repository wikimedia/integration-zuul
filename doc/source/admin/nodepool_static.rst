Nodepool - Static
=================

The static driver allows you to use existing compute resources, such as real
hardware or long-lived virtual machines, with nodepool.


Node Requirements
-----------------

Any nodes you setup for nodepool (either real or virtual) must meet
the following requirements:

* Must be reachable by Zuul executors and have SSH access enabled.
* Must have a user that Zuul can use for SSH.
* Must have Python 2 installed for Ansible.

When setting up your nodepool.yaml file, you will need the host keys
for each node for the ``host-key`` value. This can be obtained with
the command:

.. code-block:: shell

  ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 <HOST>

Nodepool Configuration
----------------------

Below is a sample Nodepool configuration file that sets up static
nodes.  Place this file in ``/etc/nodepool/nodepool.yaml``:

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/nodepool/nodepool.yaml <<EOF
   zookeeper-servers:
     - host: localhost

   labels:
     - name: ubuntu-xenial

   providers:
     - name: static-vms
       driver: static
       pools:
         - name: main
           nodes:
             - name: 192.168.1.10
               labels: ubuntu-xenial
               host-key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGXqY02bdYqg1BcIf2x08zs60rS6XhlBSQ4qE47o5gb"
               username: zuul
             - name: 192.168.1.11
               labels: ubuntu-xenial
               host-key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGXqY02bdYqg1BcIf2x08zs60rS6XhlBSQ5sE47o5gc"
               username: zuul
   EOF"

Make sure that ``username``, ``host-key``, IP addresses and label names are
customized for your environment.
